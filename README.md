# bci-transfer-learning-python

This project is dedicated to studying the transfer learning approach in binary motor imagery (MI) classification in Brain Computer interfaces (BCI). All the details on deep learning models, MI datasets, and results can be found in the PDF report. Due to the large sizes of the datasets they were not uploaded here, however, most of them are public and can be found and downloaded online.
